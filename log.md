 #### Read 100DaysOfCode Challenge article from: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/

 #### Forking this project

#### The main language I want to use is typescript. 

#### I'm planning to write some posts about the following things: reverse-proxy, docker, setup a typescript project as an executable script, and some more. Implementing the example repositories accordingly. 

#### But first of all I need to know how to be able to publish a post in one site that you already have, so I will start with that. 

### Day 1: January 6th, 2021

Today I'm trying to setup github as a site so I'm able to publish and tests the posts in local. To do that I'm following the steps indicated here: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll, but I am getting errors when I'm trying to install bundler and jekyll.
