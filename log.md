# Forking this project
# The main language I want to use is typescript. 
# I'm planning to write some posts about the following things, implementing the example repositories accordingly:
- How to configure reverse proxy with Docker
- How to run several servers in Docker serving static files
- How to call typescript project from package.json script
- How to use pupetter to access to web pages content
- How to implement a poll algorithm with typescript
- How to call a script from package.json script that calls a dependency on another project. 
- How to communicate between 2 docker instances.
# But first of all I need to know how to be able to publish a post in one site that you already have, so I will start with that.
